        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium eggplant, cubed</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep and Roast the Vegetables: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss the zucchini, eggplant, bell pepper, onion, and garlic with olive oil, Italian seasoning, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper. Spread the vegetables evenly on two baking sheet pans and roast for 25-30 minutes until tender and slightly caramelized. </li>
            <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, eggs, ½ cup Parmesan, 1 cup mozzarella, ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, basil, and parsley until well combined. </li>
            <li>Cook the Lasagna Sheets: Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. </li>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread ¼ cup marinara sauce on the bottom of a 13×9 baking pan. Lay 3 lasagna sheets on top. Spread ⅓ of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by ⅓ of the roasted vegetables. Top with marinara sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat this process twice, finishing with a final layer of noodles. Top the final layer with marinara sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. </li>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna: Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden. </li>
            <li>Let It Rest: Allow the lasagna to cool for 25-30 minutes before slicing. This ensures clean layers and an easier serving process. </li>
        </ol>
