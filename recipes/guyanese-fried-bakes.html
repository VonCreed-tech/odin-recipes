    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Looking for the perfect Guyanese fried bake recipe? This soft, fluffy, and golden Caribbean bread is a breakfast favorite across Guyana and the Caribbean. Also known as float bake, it’s delicious served with saltfish, eggs, cheese, or just butter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsp butter, softened</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (or half water, half milk for a richer dough)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add butter: Use your hands or a spoon to rub the softened butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Dissolve sugar: Mix the sugar into the warm water (or water/milk mixture), stirring until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Form the dough: Gradually add the sweetened liquid to the flour mixture, kneading for about 5 minutes until a smooth, soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Let it rest: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This helps create a light, fluffy texture when frying.</li>
        <li>Shape the bakes (choose your preferred method): 
            <p>Method 1: Roll out the dough to about ½ inch thickness and cut circles using a biscuit cutter.</p>
            <p>Method 2: Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces, shape each into a ball, and roll each one into a ½-inch thick circle. Lightly press the edges to prevent them from being too thick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Fry the bakes: In a deep pot or frying pan, heat about 3 inches of oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully place a dough round into the oil. As it puffs up, gently spoon hot oil over the top to help it float and cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook: Once golden brown on one side, flip and cook the other side until golden and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
